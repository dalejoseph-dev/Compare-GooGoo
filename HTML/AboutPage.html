            <p class="About">Compare GooGoo is about helping you make an intelligent decision when buying your next smartphone.
                Picking the latest model does not always mean it's the best for you. Instead, it's about which phone works great to satisfy your needs, whether for gaming, productivity, or keeping up with the latest on social media. Most people end up with two of the best choices after they narrow down their list. Unfortunately, this is the most challenging part since these two phones end up being very similar.
                Compare GooGoo seeks to break the ice as we present a clear side-by-side comparison between smartphone models, so you won't have to pull your hair out trying to decide between two of your best choices. 
                As new smartphone models continue to pop up, expect more comparison videos of these latest models. If you have any particular models you want to compare that we haven't done so, please feel free to contact us through our email or leave us a comment, and we'll gladly create the video for you.</p>
